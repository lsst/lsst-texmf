To get started put the directory containing LSST-beamer.sty and LSST-themes on your search path (e.g. add 
it to $TEXINPUTS). These are in the texmf folder so if you have run mktelsr they will already be found. 


You can use beamer to make LSST-flavoured talks by adding something like:
    \usepackage[fonts=false]{LSST-beamer}
to your beamer presentation (see examples/example.tex for a complete, umhh, example).  You need the
`fonts=false' if you want to use pdflatex; if you're happy with xelatex it may be omitted.

The backgrounds for the title and main pages are found in the directory LSST-themes/default. Two files are
required:
	    LSSTcover.pdf : background for cover slide
	    LSSTmain.pdf  : background for all non-cover slides
(jpg files are also allowed, e.g. LSSTcover.jpg)

default may be a symbolic link to choose the proper background, or you may specify a different directory with
the backgroundTheme option to the LSST-beamer package, e.g.
    \usepackage[backgroundTheme=LSST2016]{LSST-beamer}

You may use footline=XXX to put text in the footer, generally with the default "generic" backgroundTheme, as
many backgroundThemes already have something there.  The text may use {} to quote spaces; see
examples/example-LSST2016.tex for an example.

You may use "\position" as an alias for "\institute" (e.g. \position{DM Boss}) (but only if you
declare it after importing the LSST-beamer package).

Another common problem is DESC; they use a different layout for their cover slides --- see
examples/example-desc.tex.
