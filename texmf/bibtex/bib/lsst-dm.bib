    abstract = "{The Large-aperture Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) represents the next generation of wide-field survey telescopes. With repeated scans of the sky on timescales ranging from a few minutes to several years it will be one of the first of the wide-area survey facilities to open up the study of the time domain in astrophysics. The scientific returns from such an approach are numerous, ranging from the dynamics of near-Earth asteroids and Kuiper-belt objects through to the detection of intermediate and high redshift supernovae. We will discuss here the impact that such a diverse range of sci- entific questions will have on the analysis and management of the data flow from such a telescope. We will focus on a number of areas that must be addressed in order for the successful operation of the LSST. These will include: a) the computational challenge presented by a data rate in excess of 300GB per hour b) the impact of the optical design on the photometric accuracy and image quality of the system together with how this translates into implementing efficient techniques for measuring the differ- ences between repeated observations or for co-adding multiple images to construct a deep image of the sky c) the impact on the design of the software due to the require- ment that we be able to detect variability over a very broad range of temporal scales (from almost real-time though to several years). Throughout we will discuss the cur- rent state-of-the-art in analysis software and algorithms and how they might be expected to scale with the increase in computational resources over the coming decade. We will then identify which computational data management challenges we must address in the near future.}"

The largest transactional databases and data warehouses can no longer be hosted cost-effectively in off-the-shelf commercial database management systems. There are other forums for discussing databases and data warehouses, but they typically deal with problems occurring at smaller scales and do not always focus on practical solutions or influencing DBMS vendors. Given the relatively small (but highly influential and growing) number of users with these databases and the relatively small number of opportunities to exchange practical information related to DBMSes at extremely large scale, a workshop on extremely large databases was organized. This paper is the final report of the discussions and activities at the workshop."

The goal was to develop common requirements and primitives for a next-generation database management system that scientists would use, including those from high-energy physics, astronomy, biology, geoscience and fusion, in order to stimulate research and advance technology. These requirements were thought by the database researchers to be novel and unlikely to be fully met by current commercial vendors. The two groups accordingly decided to explore building a new open source DBMS. This paper is the final report of the discussions and activities at the workshop."

The intent has been to specify a common set of requirements for a new science data base system, which we call SciDB. In addition, we have discovered that very complex business analytics share most of the same requirements as "big science". We have also constructed a partnership of companies to fund the development of SciDB, including eBay, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), Microsoft, the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) and Vertica. Lastly, we have identified two "lighthouse customers" (LSST and eBay) who will run the initial system, once it is constructed. In this paper, we report on the requirements we have identified and briefly sketch some of the SciDB design.}

The 3rd Extremely Large Databases workshop was organized to examine the needs of scientific communities beginning to face these issues, to reach out to European communities working on extremely large scale data challenges, and to brainstorm possible solutions. The science benchmark that emerged from the 2nd workshop in this series was also debated. This paper is the final report of the discussions and activities at this workshop."

It will explore a wide range of astrophysical questions, ranging from discovering 'killer' asteroids, to examining the nature of dark energy. LSST will produce on average 15 terabytes of data per night, yielding a reduced data set of over 100 petabytes at the end of its 10-year mission. Dedicated HPC facilities (at NCSA) will process the images in near real time, with full-dataset reprocessing occurring on annual scale. A sophisticated data management system (DMS) will enable database queries from individual users, as well as computationally intensive scientific investigations that utilize the entire data set. LSST will be the first optical survey delivering petabyte-sized catalogs. Creating and mining those catalogs presents the community with significant challenges, as well as opportunities. In this colloquium I will present the science expected from LSST, the technology needed to achieve it, and provide an update of project status."

It will explore a wide range of astrophysical questions, ranging from discovering killer asteroids, to examining the nature of dark energy. LSST will produce on average 15 terabytes of data per night, yielding an (uncompressed) reduced data set of 200 petabytes at the end of its 10-year mission. Dedicated HPC facilities (with a total of 320 TFLOPS at start, scaling up to 1.7 PFLOPS by the end) will process the image data in near real time, with full-dataset reprocessings occurring on annual scale. A sophisticated data management system (DMS) will enable database queries from individual users, as well as computationally intensive scientific investigations that utilize the entire data set. The nature, quality, and volume of LSST data will be unprecedented in optical/IR astronomy, so the DMS design features petascale storage, terascale computing, and gigascale communications. LSST will be the first optical survey delivering petabyte-sized catalogs. Creating and mining those catalogs presents the community with significant challenges, as well as opportunities. I will discuss the DM system, the data products needed to achieve LSST’s science goals, the algorithms and technology being put in place to generate them, and report on DM’s progress as we prepare for Construction.",

Is this polycosm resulting in a Darwinian triumph of fitter ideas, or is it a constant re-invention of the wheel that is stopping us from making cumulative progress as a field? Is there a benefit to retaining long-term software engineering talent, and if so, can this be done on the grant system? Is it a good idea to have our software written by postdocs? By contractors? How do we compete in the free market for tech talent? Are open-source inspired initiatives (eg. AstroPy) a solution? How does the funding model for astronomy software impact the code produced, and can anybody be made to care?"

A 250 sq. deg. repeatedly-imaged stripe of the SDSS called Stripe 82 provides a strong test dataset because it was obtained under skies with highly variable conditions. Reprocessing the 20TB of imaging consisted of detecting sources on i-band co-adds but measuring flux on the single-epoch (ugriz) images, generating complete and less biased lightcurves for sources fainter than the single-epoch detection threshold. I will describe the technical challenges of aggregating these 16 billion photometry measurements into lightcurve metrics for each of the 40 million objects. I will also discuss our application of ensemble classifiers to this dataset to select z\textasciitilde 4 quasars with care to maintain the ability to estimate the completeness of the sample when the underlying population has a complex distribution in feature space."
