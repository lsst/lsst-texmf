  To add images, add the image file (png, svg or jpeg preferred) to the
  _static/ directory. The reST syntax for adding the image is

  .. figure:: /_static/filename.ext
     :name: fig-label
     :target: http://target.link/url

     Caption text.

   Run: ``make html`` and ``open _build/html/index.html`` to preview your work.
