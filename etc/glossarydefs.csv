metric,"A measurable quantity which may be tracked. A metric has a name, description, unit, references, and tags (which are used for grouping). A metric is a scalar by definition. See also: aggregate metric, model metric, point metric.",DM QA,DMTN-085,
metric value,The result of computing a particular metric on some given data. Note that metric values are typically computed rather than measured. See also: metric.,DM QA,DMTN-085,
model metric,"A metric describing a model related to the data. For example, the coefficients of a 2D polynomial fit to the background of a single CCD exposure.",DM QA,DMTN-085,
monitoring,"In DM QA, this refers to the process of collecting, storing, aggregating and visualizing metrics.",DM QA,DMTN-085,
point metric,"A metric that is associated with a single entry in a catalog. Examples include the shape of a source, the standard deviation of the flux of an object detected on a Coadd, the flux of an source detected on a difference image.",DM QA,DMTN-085,
Quality Assurance,"All activities, deliverables, services, documents, procedures or artifacts which are designed to ensure the quality of DM deliverables. This may include \gls{QC} systems, in so far as they are covered in the charge described in LDM-622. Note that contrasts with the LDM-522 definition of “QA” as “Quality Analysis”, a manual process which occurs only during commissioning and operations. See also: Quality Control.",DM QA,"DMTN-085, LDM-622",QA
Quality Control,"Services and processes which are aimed at measuring and monitoring a system to verify and characterize its performance (as in LDM-522). Quality Control systems run autonomously, only notifying people when an anomaly has been detected. See also Quality Assurance.",DM QA,"DMTN-085, LDM-522",QC
releasable product,A software package or other component of the DM system which is expected to be included in the next tagged release of the system. This implies inclusion in a standard top-level package. See also release-tag.,DM QA,DMTN-085,
tidy data,"Tidy datasets have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table (Wickham, H., 2014, Journal of Statistical Software, Articles, 59, 1).",DM QA,DMTN-085,
