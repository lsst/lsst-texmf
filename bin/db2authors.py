Load the author list and database from the support directory and
convert it to an author tex file using AASTeX6.1 syntax.

  python3 db2authors.py > authors.tex

The list of authors for the paper should be defined in a authors.yaml
file in the current working directory.  This YAML file contains a
sequence of author IDs matching the keys in the author database
file in the etc/authordb.yaml file in this package.

This program requires the "yaml" package to be installed.
