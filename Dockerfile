# Dockerized lsst-texmf
#
# This is a multi-stage docker build composed of three images:
# 1. "base" is an official Python image with additional system dependencies
#    (such as texlive) installed via the "docker/install-base-packages.sh"
#    script. Add additional apt-get dependencies through that script.
# 2. "dependencies" installs the Python dependencies defined in
#     requirements.txt.
# 3. "runtime" is the final image for end users. It is based on the "base"
#    image and includes both the Python dependencies and a copy of lsst-texmf.
